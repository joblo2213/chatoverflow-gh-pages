While plugins live in their own project, source connections (e.g. to a platform like Twitch or Discord) exist in the framework itself. We made this design choice so that all platform source connectors are free to access by all plugin developers. This wiki entry tries to show you the different steps needed to implement a new connection. Add new types to the API (Also register them in the requirement Input/Output section) Create a new package in the framework services package and implement the source specific connector Create a impl package and implement the types you have added in the API Enhance your connector with metadata Add new types to the API \u00b6 Add all needed data transfer objects in org.codeoverflow.chatoverflow.api.io.dto and interfaces representing input / output to the correct API package. E.g., a chat input belongs to org.codeoverflow.chatoverflow.api.io.input.chat and should extend ChatInput . We require you to also register your new type in the corresponding requirement class located in org.codeoverflow.chatoverflow.api.plugin.configuration . Yes, this step could be automated by using reflection, but by providing a clean interface to the plugin developer we protect type safety. Add a new package and connector \u00b6 Create a new package inside the service package of the framework: org.codeoverflow.chatoverflow.requirement.service . Next, implement a connector that extends org.codeoverflow.chatoverflow.connector.Connector which takes login data and creates a connection to the new platform. Use the lists requiredCredentialKeys and optionalCredentialKeys to set what login data you need and the credentials object to get the actual data. Implement the code that sets up the connection in the start() method and the code that closes the connection on shutdown in stop() . For logging use the logger provided by the WithLogger trait. A very basic example is the org.codeoverflow.chatoverflow.requirement.service.sample.SampleConnector . Just use the helper impl classes InputImpl and OutputImpl With this connector, you can now implement the interfaces you just added to the API. E.g. scala @Impl ( impl = classOf [ SampleInput ], connector = classOf [ SampleConnector ]) class SampleInputImpl extends InputImpl [ SampleConnector ] with SampleInput with WithLogger { override def start () : Boolean = ... override def stop () : Boolean = ... } Important The @Impl-annotation will guide the framework to load your new connector and types. Metadata \u00b6 To guide the user while adding new connectors / platform sources, we ask you to provide some metadata for your connector. Create a XML-file with the full name of your connector type, e.g. org.codeoverflow.chatoverflow.requirement.service.discord.discordchatconnector.xml inside the main/resources/connector -folder of the project. This file should contain the following information: Example <connector> <display> The Display Name </display> <description> A short description </description> <wiki> A link to the corresponding wiki entry </wiki> <icon48> a base64 encoded 48x48 png file </icon48> </connector> Note This step is optional, but highly recommended.","title":"Adding a new platform source"},{"location":"development/Adding-a-new-platform-source/#add-new-types-to-the-api","text":"Add all needed data transfer objects in org.codeoverflow.chatoverflow.api.io.dto and interfaces representing input / output to the correct API package.

As stated in the versioning article , this might be the case for: New releases ( MAJOR ): New major feature releases with (breaking) API-Updates. New major releases are always documented in the milestone -section of the github issue tracker. Feature-Upgrades ( MINOR ): Small feature upgrades, which do not require any breaking API-Updates and can be pushed earlier. Bugfixes / Hotfixes ( PATCH ): Updates to resolve bugs inside any part of the Chat Overflow project. This article guides you through the process of building, deploying and releasing new Chat Overflow versions. Please read versioning , deploying , and working with npm first and if there are any questions (or there is some information missing in the article), feel free to contact us. Overview \u00b6 The (major) release of a new Chat Overflow version can be summarized in four steps: Prepare Environment Deploy new version Release Post-Release 1. Prepare \u00b6 First, everything has to be prepared for a new release. Make sure, that all current issues are resolved (for a minor release) or all issues for a major milestone are done. Update (all) version numbers (have a look at the versioning -article). If this is a major release, this step has probably already been done (see chapter 4). Merge the master branches of the six sub-projects into the develop branches. Make sure, that all new features are now available in the develop -branch. Resolve all merge issues. This does apply to: Chat Overflow Framework (main repository) Chatoverflow-API Chatoverflow-Plugins Chatoverflow-Launcher Chatoverflow-GUI Chatoverflow-Setup Chatoverflow-Wiki (make sure not to break things here!) Test the current version at least with the testall -plugin to make sure, that there are not major flaws left. Make sure to execute the [Advanced] -task this time to rebuild everything. Create a new version of the npm-package with the new version or at least a new build version. Push your local, prepared version of all projects and mention the release state in the commit message. 2. Deploy \u00b6 After these steps, there is a merged and \"tested\" version of Chat Overflow available. Now, it's time to deploy : Use the [Deploy] -task to create a deployed version of the Chat Overflow project. Copy these files to a different directory. Then use the [DeployDev] -task to create a version of Chat Overflow for plugin developers. Do also copy this files to a different folder. For both environments / deployed versions, execute your copied versions and make sure, that everything is downloaded and starts correctly and all runtime files (e.g. the config -files) are generated. Return to your original, deployed versions. Zip them in separate files. Make sure to include all needed files but none of the generated files of your runtime versions (see deploying for more information). 3. Release \u00b6 With the two deployed versions of Chat Overflow, we are now ready to release! Upload the Chat Overflow API to the Github Maven Package Registry. For initial setup, create this file ~/.sbt/1.0/gpr-codeoverflow.sbt with the following content: credentials += Credentials ( \"GitHub Package Registry\" , \"maven.pkg.github.com\" , \"<GITHUB_USERNAME>\" , \"<GITHUB_TOKEN>\" ) Then, you can simply publish a new version (the version of the main api sbt file is used) by executing sbt apiProject/publish . Draft a new release . Set the tag version to the version to release (following the main sbt version) and the target to the develop -branch. Write release notes. These notes should at least contain the following information: Generic information, (major) changes, pull requests. Just have a look at existent releases . Upload both zip files with the deployed (and plugin-dev-deployed) versions of Chat Overflow. Double check again, that every step is completed and everything looks fine. Then, release ! 4. Post-Release \u00b6 After the release, some things have to be cleaned up. By releasing, the current state of the selected branch in the main project is automatically tagged with the release version, e.g. v3.2.1 . All other current states of all other projects (e.g. API, GUI, and so on) have to be tagged, too. Merge the current states of all develop -branches in the master -branches, since these should always contain the currently released version. This should cause no problems though, because you already merged the master -branches in chapter 1. But it opens up new space for a new development version. Add a commit to all develop -branches, incrementing the version number. If the increment is major or minor has to be determined first. Delete all dead branches on all projects. This is applicable to all branches, which have been successfully merged into the develop - or master -branch and whose issue has been closed. If you're not sure about a branch, please ask first. That's it. Get yourself a cup of coffee, take a nap or cry in pain. A new version of Chat Overflow has been released, and it's time to start over again with the development of the next release.

Obviously, we use git and every component is available through github. Versioned artefacts \u00b6 The following components / artefacts / parts of the Chat Overflow project have a dedicated version number: Framework (contains startup code and service implementation, specifies release version) API (contains interfaces to connect every plugin to the framework, specifies executable plugin versions) REST-API (used to control the framework) NPM package version (used for client bindings to the REST-API, should always be the same as above) GUI (the version of the frontend implementation) These versions are displayed while the framework is starting.

The package is generated using swagger annotations in our scala implementation of the interface. By this approach we ensure maximum reliability while having minimal manual implementation effort. The npm package is hosted with the new github package registry and can be found here . This article describes, how new versions of the package with the client bindings can be generated and published. This is important for team members and everyone interested in (G)UI development. Prerequisites \u00b6 There are three basic steps for settings started with this process. Install node / npm . If you have it already installed, make sure to update it to the last release using sudo npm install -g npm@latest . Login to the github package registry. This is described here . Basically, it's one console command using a personal token from your github user settings : npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com Download the latest 2.x -version of swagger-codegen-cli . It can be found on maven . Please make sure, that you do not use the 3.x .-version, since it is not compatible with your current framework dependencies. At the time of writing this article, the latest 2.x -version is 2.4.9 . Build \u00b6 Next up, you can build a new version of the npm package. This is also applicable, if you won't publish the package and just want to test something locally. Start by increasing the build-part of the version number of the REST-API by 1. It can be found the VersionInfo -file (called rest ). The build number is the last part, e.g. going from 3.0.0-5 to 3.0.0-6 . This step is only needed once per published version of your npm package build. Start the framework and make sure, that the build version increase worked and your changes to the REST-API are available. Generate the npm package using swagger-codegen-cli . This can be achieved with the following console command (the backslahes are only needed for *nix-systems): java -jar swagger-codegen-cli-2.4.9.jar generate \\ -i http://localhost:2400/api-docs/swagger.json \\ -l typescript-angular \\ -o ./angular_api_client \\ --additional-properties npmName=@codeoverflow-org/chatoverflow,snapshot=false,npmVersion=x.x.x-x,ngVersion=7.2.1 Make sure to replace the npm-version with the version number you have used in the VersionInfo -file, e.g. 3.0.0-6 . Next, some dependencies have to be installed.

This is also applicable, if you won't publish the package and just want to test something locally. Start by increasing the build-part of the version number of the REST-API by 1. It can be found the VersionInfo -file (called rest ). The build number is the last part, e.g. going from 3.0.0-5 to 3.0.0-6 . This step is only needed once per published version of your npm package build. Start the framework and make sure, that the build version increase worked and your changes to the REST-API are available. Generate the npm package using swagger-codegen-cli . This can be achieved with the following console command (the backslahes are only needed for *nix-systems): java -jar swagger-codegen-cli-2.4.9.jar generate \\ -i http://localhost:2400/api-docs/swagger.json \\ -l typescript-angular \\ -o ./angular_api_client \\ --additional-properties npmName=@codeoverflow-org/chatoverflow,snapshot=false,npmVersion=x.x.x-x,ngVersion=7.2.1 Make sure to replace the npm-version with the version number you have used in the VersionInfo -file, e.g. 3.0.0-6 .

So this guide will probably change in the future! There are 3 important steps when you want to create and implement a new chat overflow plugin: Create a new plugin project with the commands of the framework Inspect the plugin.xml file Extend the plugin with own logic Create a new plugin project \u00b6 Use the Create Plugin run configuration or start the custom task sbt create directly. Enter the basic plugin information in the command prompt. This includes mandatory values like the name, author, version and base plugin folder (e.g. plugins-public ) and some optional values like a description, a website, a link to a source repo, a link to a bug tracker and a license. The command creates the folder structure of the new plugin and adds a basic build file. Here you can also add custom dependencies. In addition the command generates a basic plugin.xml containing all the passed information like name and description and a basic source code file generated in the language of your choice to get you started. Note that currently only Scala and Java are supported. Next, run the custom task sbt fetch to let the framework look for new plugins and update the plugin reference file plugins.sbt . If you're using IntelliJ, you can now reload the framework manually to register the plugin as a new custom project. You should also run sbt reload (Yes, both actions have different effects although they shouldn't). Inspect the plugin.xml file \u00b6 All the metadata of the plugin like the name and the author of the plugin is saved in a xml file which is located at src/main/resources/plugin.xml in the plugin directory. This file gets autogenerated by the create command, but in case you need to update a value its good to know where this file is located. A simple version of the plugin.xml file might look like this: Example <plugin> <name> Demonstration </name> <author> sebinside </author> <description> This is a simple plugin for demonstration purposes. </description> <api> <major> 3 </major> <minor> 0 </minor> </api> <version> 0.3.0 </version> <website> http://codeoverflow.org </website> <sourceRepo> https://github.com/codeoverflow-org/chatoverflow-plugins </sourceRepo> <bugtracker> https://github.com/codeoverflow-org/chatoverflow/issues </bugtracker> <license> EPL-2.0 </license> </plugin> The properties called name, author, api versions and version are mandatory and the framework won't load the plugin, if one of these is missing. All others are optional information for the user. If you don't want to specify a value for those you can just omit them. The api tag contains the API-Version, which your plugin uses. These are evaluated in the loading process to ensure that your plugin works with the framework version from the user. You can get these numbers either from org.codeoverflow.chatoverflow.api.APIVersion in the api project or in the build.sbt also in the api project. Extend the Plugin with own logic \u00b6 The last step is the creation of the plugin class, which contains your own plugin logic. Again the create command has autogenerated a basic class extending org.codeoverflow.chatoverflow.api.plugin.PluginImpl in the language of your choice. Such a file might look like this in case of Scala: Example scala import org.codeoverflow.chatoverflow.api.plugin. { PluginImpl , PluginManager } class DemonstrationPlugin ( manager : PluginManager ) extends PluginImpl ( manager ) { // require more requirements as needed here private val sampleReq = require . input . sample ( \"sampleReq\" , \"Sample requirement\" , true ) // you can adjust the loop interval here // loopInterval = 1000; /** * The setup method is executed one, when the plugin is started. Do NOT define your requirements in here! */ override def setup () : Unit = { log ( \"Initialized Demonstration!\" ) } /** * The loop method is executed in loop with a specified interval until the shutdown method is called. * The loop method is NOT executed if a negative loop interval is set. */ override def loop () : Unit = { log ( \"Demonstration loop!\" ) } /** * The shutdown method should contain logic to close everything. */ override def shutdown () : Unit = { log ( \"Shutting down Demonstration!\" ) } } The framework searches for a class implementing org.codeoverflow.chatoverflow.api.plugin.Plugin when it tries to load a plugin. PluginImpl does this for you and also decreases some other boilerplate. Note that the whole plugin is only allowed to have exactly one class implementing Plugin otherwise the framework won't load your plugin. All methods in the generated class are pretty self explaining. The only thing we might need to talk about are Requirements : These are used to retrieve data from the outside world and returning information to it. Basically, you can require everything from a single parameter set by the user to full access to a users livestream chat. Thanks to PluginImpl a requirements object is already created, meaning you can start adding requirements right away. Here is a example: Example scala private val twitchChatInput = require . input . twitchChat ( \"reqTwitch\" , \"A twitch channel\" , false ) private val nameToSayHelloTo = require . parameter . string ( \"reqHello\" , \"Your name\" , false ) This code requires read access to a twitch livestream chat and a parameter (\" a name to say hello to\" ). Note: You can obviously not specify which channel the user might choose - but you can be sure that you will get a working input. The framework takes care of that. After this, the last step is the start method. And it is as easy as you might think: Just add your own logic now, using the required parameters of your Requirement object. Here is a short example: This code will simply print out all messages from a twitch chat to the console. To access the chat, use the get() method on the requirement. Example scala twitchChatInput . get (). registerMessageHandler ( msg => println ( msg )) Of course, you can also add own classes and infrastructure by now - the important steps are done, happy coding! One last note: If you are testing your plugin for the first time, a full reload might be needed. Use the custom task [Advanced] Full Reload and run ChatOverflow to do so.

Installation \u00b6 Head over to the releases tab and download the ChatOverflow .zip file from the assets section of the latest release. Extract the zip file. (It's clever to extract it in a folder called chatoverflow \ud83d\ude09) If you are on Windows, execute ChatOverflow.bat .

Starting the Better REPL \u00b6 When using the GUI for the first time use the [Advanced] run configuration that packages the gui. Make sure to reload sbt afterwards to make IntelliJ find and load the gui. For all further runs you may use the [Simple] run configuration which is way faster. Once the framework is running open http://localhost:2400/ in a browser and wait for the server status to display Connected! . Now click on OPEN BETTER REPL . When running for the first time enter a password that you want to use for securing your credentials and click on REGISTER . If you are already registered, use your password to login. If the login was successful the gui will display the authentication key for this session. Creating a plugin instance \u00b6 Before running a plugin you have to create a plugin instance. All available plugins are listed under Plugin types . Add more plugins by putting the plugin .jar files into the plugins folder. If you are adding new plugins to the folder while the framework is still running, you need to restart the framework in order for it to load the newly added plugins. Enter the plugin and author name of the plugin and give the instance a name (whatever you like), then click on CREATE : The plugin instance should now be listed under Plugin instances : You can use the pen to copy the name of an instance. There are buttons that allow you to START / STOP an instance, to show its log (if running) or requirements and a button to DELETE the instance (just make sure to stop it before deleting it). Setting plugin requirements \u00b6 Before you can start a plugin you need to set its requirements. A plugin can require a lot of things, for example Strings, Inputs or Outputs. To view all requirements of a plugin enter the instance name and click on SHOW REQUIREMENTS . You see that each requirement has a type and needs a value. You see which requirements are already set and which ones are optional. To set or change the value click on the blue pen, enter the required value and click on PUT . For inputs and outputs the value should be the source identifier of a connector - which you first have to define. Adding connectors \u00b6 To add a connector use whatever source identifier you like, specify the connector type (a list of all types can be found in the connector types box above) and click ADD . It will then be displayed in the list on the left side. Set credentials \u00b6 Every connector requires you to set the credentials for that service. Some of them are required for the connector to work and some are optional. Click on the Request details... link. Then the gui will display if the connector is running and which credentials should be set. Underlined ones are required, the plain ones are optional. Use the blue pen to copy the key, the identifier and the type of the connector and then use the manage credentials field to add the value of the credentials. If you are getting errors when adding credentials Frequent-Issues might contain a solution. Info Added credentials are encrypted with AES 128/256. The password is not stored anywhere. If you loose your password, there will be no way to reuse your configured and saved credentials.*","title":"Using the GUI"},{"location":"usage/Using-the-GUI/#starting-the-better-repl","text":"When using the GUI for the first time use the [Advanced] run configuration that packages the gui. Make sure to reload sbt afterwards to make IntelliJ find and load the gui. For all further runs you may use the [Simple] run configuration which is way faster.
